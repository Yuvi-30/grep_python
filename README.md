This code is a clone of GREP command used in linux which is made in Python

Various features that can be used are:

	search a pattern and display matching lines.	
	colorize the pattern.
	count the number of lines in which a pattern occured.
	find a whole word only in files
	search by ignoring the cases.
	display lines that dont match the pattern.
	display a specified number of lines before and after each matching line (context).
	supports basic regular expressions for more advanced pattern matching.

1) To use this code :
2) We can directly type "python greps.py pattern file_name(1 or more with spaces) argument(1 or more with spaces)" in the terminal itself.
3) For using spec enter "--spec no_of_line" along with context and other optional arguments.
